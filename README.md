# Data-Science-Programming-Projects

This is my Spring 2023 ISM6251 Data Science Programming weekly Projects repository whcih includes Inclass exercises, Weekly exercises and Assignments.

 **Assigenment-Business Scenario:**

A new company has entered the market and is looking to increase its sales by launching marketing campaigns to reach potential customers. The company is focused on building its own brand and wants to ensure that it is targeting the audience and ready to spend its maximum marketing budget.

To achieve this, the company plans to use a machine learning model to identify potential customers who are likely to make a purchase on their website. The company has collected data on visitors to their website, including the number of pages viewed, the time spent on the website, the type of visitor, and the location of the visitor.

I used different clasification model to predit user purchase intensions. Visit folder Onlineshopper purchasing intensions  and see deployed models and analysis

**WE01 Data prep: Used different encoding techniques to prepare data for analysis**

**WE02-Regression:** 

                    1. Increase the amount of noise added to the data and analysed its impact on data

                    2. Decrease the number of observations generated and analysed its impact on data.

**WE03-SVM: Developed a predictive model that predicts lawn mower ownership (use the RisingMower.csv data) using SVM classification and other. saved the best model and Created an application that asks the user for an income and lot size and answers if it's predicted that this property would own a lawnmower**

**WE04-Universal Bank: Universal bank has recently trialed a marketing campaign to sell their new CD account product to existing customers. They contacted 5000 of their non-CD account customers with an offer. The data provided in universal.csv is the result of this market test. Used RandomSearchCV combined with GridSearchCV to identify the best parameters for each model tested.**

**WE06-Text Mining: Explored the impacts of applying SVD to the data.  Analyzed how changing the n_components parameter impacts the modeling results. Use the values 100, 300, and 500 and how each of these values impacted the performance of the models.**

**WE07-Neural Networks: Added Neural Networks to my assignment-1 Online shopper purchasing intensions and compared noemal classification models and Neural network models**

**WE10- RNN predicted Delta Airlines stock price by RNN, LTSM, Gru, and Conv1D techniques to predict the 10th-day closing pric baseed on past nine days**

**WE-11 Autoencoders: Predicted letter by adding letter images to MNIST digits data**
